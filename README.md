# FamilyMap
Fully functional Android app that includes Amazon Maps, and server communication. This project was originally for a class, and we were given minimal specs - an API and things to pass off. The rest was up to us. I chose to implement Google's Material Design for a clean and consistent look across the app.

To run this app yourself, you can download the APK. This app uses the Amazon Maps API, and because of that requires a Kindle device to run properly. If you don't have a Kindle to run this, you can check out the screenshots folder to see what the app looks like.

The backend server is hosted on my computer - text me at 385-290-7346 or email me at xander.moffatt@gmail.com, and I'll spin it up so you can log in. The username and password are "x", and I will provide you with the IP address.
